      "value": "M. Sgt. Harry M. Braxton Sr. was assigned to the Quartermaster Corps during World War II and was a driver with the Red Ball Express. When army general George S. Patton made a rapid advance across France in 1944, he stretched his supply line to near collapse. 20 hours a day, seven days a week for 82 days across France and into Germany, often facing arrack from the ground and the air. Nearly 75 percent of Red Ball Express drivers, like Braxton, were African Americans. Later Braxton served with Grave Registration and worked to give Holocaust victims the respect they deserved in death by providing them with proper burial. Years later, when he reflected on  his service, he expressed great admiration for General Patton and was proud to have served."
