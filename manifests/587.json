      "value": "Embry AME Church was founded in 1903 in the home of Samuel and Georgianna Stewart. The congregation built a chapel in 1905 in a low-lying section of the community. In 1918, the building was moved to a site on Lakeland Road.  In 1920, a new church on the same location replaced the chapel. Over time, a parish hall and study were added. The building is showed here around 1965.   (Courtesy of Thelma Lomax) "
